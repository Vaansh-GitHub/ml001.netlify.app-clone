<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <h1>Heading 1</h1><!--this indicates the most important heading in an html document therefore it has a largest font size unless external styling is applied to it-->
    <h2>Heading 2</h2><!--this is also a heading but it is the second most important heading and has a font size slightly less than the most important heading-->
    <h3>Heading 3</h3><!--this is also a heading but it is the third most important heading and has a font size slightly less than the second most important heading-->
    <h4>Heading 4</h4><!--this is also a heading but it is the fourth important heading and has a font size slightly less than the third most important heading-->
    <h5>Heading 5</h5><!--this is also a heading but it is the fifth important heading and has a font size slightly less than the fourth important heading-->
    <h6>Heading 6</h6><!--Last but not the least this is the least important heading and has a font size less than all other heading elements-->
    <!--In the Output as we are moving down the heading size is decreasing this is the only difference between them-->

    <!--Yet the font size of the headings can be changed by using CSS,Here i have used the style attribute to change the font size (We will see a detailed description of style attribute in the attributes lecture) of the most important heading to 20px and the least important heading to 30px,You can see the effect in the output.-->
    <h1 style="font-size:20px;">This is the most important heading</h1>
    <h6 Style="font-size:30px;">This is the least important heading</h6>
