    <p>Hello Everyone to this tutorials.
       In this Tutorial We will Study about all paragraph elements.
       You would be thinking that this 'p' element will exactly print the text as it is but it is not.
       Read the comments in code for more details about this element.
    </p><!--This is a block element it will print the text in the browser window at every new line (in a single 'p' element the line breaks are not considered that is the each line will be side by side see the output for difference.)-->
    <br><!--this is an empty element and it provides a line break after every element whether it is inline or block level we will give a about the basic overview of inline or block line later in the this lecture and know more about them later in this tutorial.Try removing the 'br' tag to see what happens to the webpage.-->
    <p>Hello welcome to todays lecture</p>
    <p>We will analyize about the paragraph element in this lecture</p><!--To write this sentence with a line we have to use two 'p'elements see below for better approach.-->
    <p>Hello welcome to todays lecture<br>We will analyize about the paragraph element in this lecture</p><!--we can use a 'br' element inside another element for an immediate line break.it is better than the above approach.-->
    <hr><!--This is also an empty element it provides a thematic break see the output in the browser there will be an line exactly below the above 'p' element and the cursor will be below the line.-->
    <!--Imagine someone has given you a challenge to write some sentences as it was given with a line break after every sentence without using a 'br' tag and in a single elements here is when the 'pre' element comes into action.Let us take the first example of this lecture.-->

    </pre><!--This tag will print exactly what it contains that is with the line breaks too in monospace font for more information you can see the output in the browser window.-->

<!--Some Important Defination-->
<!--Inline Elements are those elements which are not executed on a new line they will be shown in as much width provided to them.-->
<!--Block Elements are those elements which are executed on a new line they take up as much space needed by them to execute.-->
<!--the common elements we use has a starting tag and an ending tags and they also contain some content too. For example,<p>Hello</p>.the syntax is <tagname>content</tagname>-->
<!--an element with no closing tag and content are called as empty elements.For example,<br> tag -->
<!--Don't misconsider just an opening element to be an empty element.For example,only this "<p>" is not an empty element it is called be a syntax error.-->
